# LESS-SASS
#### The language of SASS is called SassScript. The preprocessor was originally built on the markup language YAML before it was introduced as its own script language with SASS you have some options that aren’t offered by CSS alone:

Variables: With SASS, you can save information in variables to be used again later. So it’s possible, for example, to centrally store a color value under a catchier variable.
Mathematical functions: In SASS, you can also use mathematical operations like +, -, *, /, or %. This allows you to influence size specifications, for example.
Functions: Other functions also make it easier to work on the design. These allow you to modify color values or analyze lists, among other things.
Loops: Another advantage of SASS is the ability to set up loops. These are repeated until they reach a status defined by you.
Case distinctions: These have a similar function to the conditional instructions “if” and “else.” The given commands are only run if specific conditions are met.
Mixins: Mixins, simply said, are templates. You can either create them yourself or simply integrate them into your own code when using a framework.
Indentations: The original SASS (as opposed to SCSS) works with indentations and line breaks to structure the code. You don’t need parentheses to display nesting or semicolons to mark line ends.
Nesting: CSS doesn’t allow you to work with nesting in the code. SASS, though, gives users the option to present dependencies visually to reduce redundancies and simplify the writing process.
Inheritances: It’s possible to inherit properties from one selector to another. This saves some writing effort and keeps the code slimmer.
Partial files: To integrate code elements into a SASS file, you can also use partials. These are files that only have to contain a few lines of CSS and are imported into a SASS file by command.

LESS has also established itself in developer circles. This stylesheet language is strongly oriented around CSS and resembles SCSS in its syntax. Both preprocessors share some of the same properties: Both SASS and LESS allow for the use of mixins and variables. One difference, though, is that SASS is based on Ruby, while LESS uses JavaScript. But even this doesn’t give either of the preprocessors an advantage over the others.

The real differences are found instead in the logical functions: LESS gives users the opportunity to only activate mixins when specific situations occur. This is a helpful feature, but it represents the extent of logical links in LESS. SASS, on the other hand, offers loops and case distinctions as known from programming languages.

With SASS, users are free to choose between “indented syntax” or SCSS. Each developer can decide for themselves whether they would like to move away from the CSS rules or stay closer to the original. LESS doesn’t offer this choice. Here, users have to stick with the old rules. Code in LESS is automatically a superset of CSS: All source text formulated in CSS also functions in LESS – just like with SCSS.
